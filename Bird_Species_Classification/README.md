## Bird Classification

## 1. Introduction
There are so many species of birds and it can get really hard even for experts to tell which family a bird belongs to. Here machine learning model can make our task easy.
 
## 2. Objective

In this project, we have 375 bird species and each species has around 150 images. Transfer learning is being used to initialize the weights. Resnet, VGG16, InceptionV3 and Xception pre-trained models are used. 

## 3. Steps to execute this Project.
NOTE: Running the whole project might take an extended period of time. Training time also depends on your system's computation capabilities.
1. Download/fork/clone the project by clicking [here] (https://github.com/balusena/balugithub/tree/master/Bird_Species_Classification) or just unzip the folder provided.
2. src/ directory contains the notebook with data prep and modelling code. Put the training bird images in data/train/ and test images in the data/test/ directory.
3. In case you just want to see how the model is working, the model is provided in the models/ directory, load the model and go to the "Model Evaluation" section of the notebook and run the cells under that section.


## 4. Reports
- Report is available in the reports/ directory.

## 5. Important Consideration
This project runs perfectly fine on a windows machine by following the steps mentioned in section 3. If want to run on a different OS, encoding might need to be changed.
