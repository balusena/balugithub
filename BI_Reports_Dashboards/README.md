## 3.Further work to be done:
-1.Planning to implement these projects on PowerBI tool by using databases connections for E(Extract)-T(Transform)-L(Load) process and applying DataWareHouse(DWH) techniques.
-2.Find a way to build BI Reports and Dashboards by using Tableau(I would be grateful if someone could help me on this project enhancement.)
